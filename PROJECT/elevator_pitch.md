Project Elevator Pitch
----------------------

**Summary:**
Create a system for grouping similar music artists based on genre and user listen activity. The end result should be a recommendation system which will provide related artists.

**Problem:** 
At my work (*bop.fm*) we have a system in place, provided by a third party, which will provide related songs given a seed song.  What is currently missing is the same functionality for artists (i.e. related artists given a seed artist).  This is a popular feature among other streaming music platforms and is important in our product offering.

**Data Set:**
I plan to use internal company data, specifically user listen behavior.  In addition, I'll have to fill in some missing genre data which I'll get from a 3rd party API (not sure which yet, maybe iTunes).

**ML Problem:**
clustering problem (*i think*) because there is no ground truth and I'm trying to group related objects.
